# Analyzing Wealth Inequality in the United States (1990-2023)

This repository contains data and code for analyzing wealth inequality in the United States from 1990 to 2023. The primary source of data is the Federal Reserve, and this project aims to provide insights into how wealth distribution has evolved during this period. Additionally, it includes data visualizations and in-depth analyses of individual-level wealth changes.

## Data Source

The primary source of data for this analysis is the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/). The Federal Reserve provides a wealth of economic data, including statistics on household wealth and income distribution, which we've used to create this analysis.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to gain a deep understanding of how wealth inequality has progressed in the United States over the years. We will focus on the following key areas:

1. **Wealth Distribution Trends:** We will use data visualizations to illustrate how wealth has been distributed among different income groups and demographic categories over time.

2. **Individual-Level Changes:** This analysis will include a detailed examination of how individual wealth has changed from 1990 to 2023. We will look into factors that have contributed to these changes and explore any emerging patterns.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `dfa-networth-levels.csv/`: This directory contains the raw data obtained from the Federal Reserve. It includes data files for different years and relevant metadata.

- `SQL queries for wealth project.txt/`: Power query and sql used for data cleaning. 

- `wealth data project.pbix/`: Plots and charts generated from the analysis, which provide visual insights into wealth distribution and individual-level changes.

- `wealth data project.pdf/`: pdf file of the visualzation.

- `README.md`: The main documentation file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, you will need the following:

1. Python environment: We recommend using a Jupyter notebook for running the code. You can set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries by using the `requirements.txt` file in this repository.

2. Data: You can download the relevant data from the Federal Reserve website ([Federal Reserve Data](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)) and place it in the `data/` directory.

3. Notebooks: Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and follow the step-by-step analysis and visualization process.

## Data Visualization

In the `notebooks/` directory, you will find Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the data analysis and visualization. We will use Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to create informative charts and graphs that illustrate wealth distribution trends.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the Federal Reserve for providing valuable data that made this analysis possible.
